🧠 Loan Approval Prediction using ANN with Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME, Permutation Importance)

This mini project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict loan approval status using a real-world dataset and explains the model’s predictions using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Permutation Feature Importance.

The goal is not just high accuracy, but also model interpretability, making it suitable for real-world applications like banking and finance where decisions must be transparent.

🚀 Features

✅ Binary classification (Loan Approved / Rejected)
✅ Data preprocessing & feature scaling
✅ ANN model using TensorFlow / Keras
✅ Model evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
✅ Training vs Validation accuracy plot
✅ Explainable AI techniques:

🔍 SHAP – global & local feature importance

💡 LIME – instance-level explanations

🔁 Permutation Importance – feature relevance
